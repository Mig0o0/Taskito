# Taskito

Taskito is a simple yet powerful dashboard designed to manage an API exposed by a mobile application. The project aims to promote collaboration and productivity among team members, encouraging competition through task-based point systems. By breaking down larger projects into smaller, manageable tasks, Taskito helps teams work efficiently while staying motivated.

## Features

### Task Management
- **Task CRUD Operations:** Create, read, update, and delete tasks with ease.
- **Nested Tasks:** Break down big projects into smaller, actionable tasks.

### Task History
- Track task completion history.
- View details about who finished the task and when.

### Task Hints and Points
- **Hints System:** Each task can include hints. Opening a hint reduces the task's points by a specified amount set by the admin.
- **Points System:** Tasks are assigned points to encourage competition and reward effort.

### Task Assignment
- Tasks are not pre-assigned. Instead, team members can claim tasks they want to work on by confirming their choice.

### Real-Time Updates
- **Pusher Integration:** Real-time updates for task status and team activity, ensuring everyone is always up-to-date.
